### What is the game of Tower of Hanoi?
- Tower of Hanoi consists of three pegs or towers with n disks placed one over the other.

- The objective of the puzzle is to move the stack to another peg following these simple rules.

- 1.Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- 2.No disk can be placed on top of the smaller disk.

### Tower of Hanoi algorithm explained
- Let’s try to solve a puzzle – Tower of Hanoi using recursion.

- Take an example with 2 disks: Disk 1 on top of Disk 2 at peg A. The target is to move both these disks to peg B.

#### Looks simple, Right!

- Move Disk 1 from peg A to peg C. Then move disk 2 from peg A to peg B and, finally, move disk 1 from peg C to peg B.

- This solution takes 3 steps.

- You can easily move this stack from peg B to any other peg using these 3 steps.

- But what if we have 3 disks – 1,2, and 3 stacked in peg A.

- To move the stack to peg B you would have to expose disk 3 and to do that disk 1 and 2 have to be moved to peg C.

- So by ensuring that you do not break the rules, using the above subsets of 3 steps in the previous case, you would move disk 1 and 2 to peg C, leaving disk 3 
 exposed with no disk above it.

- How to solve the problem, recursively move disk 3 from peg A to peg B.

- Then disk 1 from peg C to peg A. After which disk 2 can be moved above disk 3 at peg B.

- The puzzle is finally completed by moving disk 1 from peg A over disk 2 and 3 at peg B.

### What if you have 4 disks?

- Recursively solve the problem of moving disk 1,2, and 3 from peg A to peg C
- Move disk 4 from A to C
- Recursively solve the problem of moving disk 1,2 and 3 from peg C to peg B
- Eventually, you figure out that there is some pattern to the puzzle and with each increment in disks, the pattern could be followed recursively.

- While the 3-disk puzzle required 7 steps. 4-disk requires 7+1+7 = 15 steps to be solved.

- Create a function Tower with int ‘a’ – for number of disks, char ‘from’ – for from peg, char ‘aux’ – for a secondary peg, char ‘to’ – for destination peg
 Put ‘if’ loop
- If (a=1) i.e. if number of disk = 1, move it from ‘initial peg’ to the ‘destination peg’
- Else, call function tower for ‘a-1’ i.e. the number of disk -1, recall function tower for n-1 disk and move it ‘from’ to ‘to’
- Recall function again using recursion until an or number of the disk is 1.
