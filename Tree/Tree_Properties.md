# Binary Tree Has 6 Propaerties

## The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l:    take this as example explain me this propartie

# Binary Tree Node Levels

In a binary tree, each node has at most two children. The level of a node is defined by its distance from the root node:

- **Level 0:** The root node.
- **Level 1:** The children of the root node.
- **Level 2:** The children of the nodes at level 1.
- **Level 3:** The children of the nodes at level 2.
- And so on.

The maximum number of nodes at each level \( l \) is given by the formula \( 2^l \). This exponential growth is due to the binary branching factor where each node can have up to two children.

## Maximum Nodes at Each Level

1. **Level 0:**
   - **Nodes:** [2]
   - **Maximum nodes:** \( 2^0 = 1 \)

2. **Level 1:**
   - **Nodes:** [7, 5]
   - **Maximum nodes:** \( 2^1 = 2 \)

3. **Level 2:**
   - **Nodes:** [2, 6, 9]
   - **Maximum nodes:** \( 2^2 = 4 \)

4. **Level 3:**
   - **Nodes:** [5, 11, 4]
   - **Maximum nodes:** \( 2^3 = 8 \)

## Summary

- **Level 0:** The root node (2) is at level 0 and matches the maximum of \( 2^0 = 1 \).
- **Level 1:** There are 2 nodes (7, 5), matching the maximum of \( 2^1 = 2 \).
- **Level 2:** There are 3 nodes (2, 6, 9), which is less than the maximum of \( 2^2 = 4 \).
- **Level 3:** There are 3 nodes (5, 11, 4), which is less than the maximum of \( 2^3 = 8 \).

This example demonstrates that while the maximum number of nodes at level \( l \) is \( 2^l \), not all levels will necessarily have the maximum number of nodes due to the possibility of nodes having fewer than two children.
