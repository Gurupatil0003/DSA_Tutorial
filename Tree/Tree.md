# Tree

- To retrace our steps a bit, a tree data structure is a way of organizing data in a hierarchical manner. Just like in nature, trees in our computer world come in 
 many shapes and sizes. For our purposes, letâ€™s visualize one that looks as follows:

- We see a bunch of circles and lines connecting each circle. Each circle in the tree is known as a node. The node plays an important role in a tree. It is 
 responsible - for storing data, and it is also responsible for linking to other nodes. The link (visualized as a line) between each node is known as an edge:

# Trees in Data Structures
- A tree is a hierarchical data structure, which has one root node and multiple child nodes(branches). Unlike, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks or queues, a Tree is non 
 linear data structure.![tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a72a05-e5bf-42ed-aae6-5bb0708268d9)
