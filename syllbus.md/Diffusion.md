- google.colab.drive: Used to mount Google Drive into the Colab environment, giving access to the files and folders stored in Drive.

- IPython.display.clear_output(): Used to clear previous output from the notebook's output cells.

- ipywidgets: Provides interactive widgets (like buttons) for use in Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

- os: A standard Python library that allows interacting with the file system, like checking if directories exist.

```python
def inf(msg, style, wdth):
    inf = widgets.Button(
        description=msg,

        button_style=style, 
        layout=widgets.Layout(min_width=wdth)

Architecture Overview

User Input: User provides an image (for example, a sketch or pose).

Preprocessing with ControlNet: ControlNet guides the generation process using additional control signals like depth, pose, or canny edges.

LoRA Fine-tuning: Lightweight LoRA models customize the generation process based on specific styles or domains without retraining the whole model.

Stable Diffusion Model: Generates the final image using the input and ControlNet/LoRA guidance.

Postprocessing & Output: Returns the generated image to the user.
