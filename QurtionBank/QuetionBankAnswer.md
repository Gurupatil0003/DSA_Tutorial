# 1.What is a data structure? Explain its importance

- A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. It provides a way to structure data so that it can be accessed and modified effectively. Common data structures 
 include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Importance of Data Structures:

- Efficiency: Different data structures offer various ways to store and retrieve data efficiently. For example, hash tables provide fast access to data, while trees can help with hierarchical data and efficient 
 searching.

- Performance: The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance of algorithms. For instance, a binary search tree allows for quicker searches, insertions, and deletions compared to a linear 
 search in an array.

- Resource Management: Data structures help in managing memory and other resources more effectively. They can optimize space and time complexity, which is crucial for handling large datasets.

- Algorithm Implementation: Many algorithms are built upon specific data structures. For example, graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm use priority queues (a type of data structure) to find the shortest path 
 between nodes.

- Abstraction and Modularity: Data structures provide a way to encapsulate and manage data separately from the operations performed on it. This abstraction helps in designing and implementing complex systems in a 
 modular fashion.

| **Implementation**    | Can be more straightforward but may not utilize space as effectively                | More complex due to circular indexing but maximizes space utilization           |

# 6.Explain the concept of a linked list. How is it different from an array? 

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**         | Nodes with data and references to next (and previous in doubly)     | Contiguous memory block                                |
| **Size**              | Dynamic; grows or shrinks as needed                                | Fixed size; predefined at creation                    |
| **Access Time**       | O(n); requires traversal from the head (or tail in doubly)          | O(1); direct access via index                          |
| **Insertion/Deletion**| Efficient; involves updating references                            | Inefficient; requires shifting elements                |

# 7.Comparison Between Array and Linked List

| **Aspect**                | **Array**                                          | **Linked List**                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**     | **Contiguous Memory**: Allocates a block of memory in a contiguous manner. | **Non-Contiguous Memory**: Uses scattered memory locations, with each element pointing to the next. |
| **Size**                  | **Fixed Size**: Size is determined at creation and cannot be changed dynamically. | **Dynamic Size**: Size can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. |
| **Access Time**           | **O(1) Access Time**: Direct access to elements using indices is possible, making retrieval very fast. | **O(n) Access Time**: Requires traversing the list from the head to access an element, making it slower. |
| **Insertion/Deletion**    | **O(n) Time Complexity**: Involves shifting elements, which can be costly for large arrays. | **O(1) Time Complexity (at known positions)**: Efficient insertion and deletion if the position is known, especially at the head or tail. |
| **Memory Overhead**       | **Low Overhead**: Minimal overhead as arrays do not store additional information apart from the elements. | **High Overhead**: Additional memory overhead due to storing pointers alongside data elements. |
| **Ease of Implementation**| **Simple Implementation**: Requires less code to implement basic operations. | **Complex Implementation**: Requires extra code to manage pointers and handle dynamic memory allocation. |
| **Traversal**             | **Linear Traversal**: Supports direct access to any element but requires linear traversal for operations like sorting. | **Sequential Traversal**: Requires traversing from the head, but traversal can be more flexible with doubly or circular linked lists. |
| **Resizing**              | **Static Size**: Does not support dynamic resizing; dynamic arrays (e.g., `ArrayList` in Java) handle resizing internally. | **Dynamic Size**: Supports resizing naturally as elements can be added or removed without resizing the entire structure. |
| **Use Cases**             | **Fixed-size Collections**: Suitable when the number of elements is known and does not change frequently, such as look-up tables. | **Dynamic Collections**: Ideal when the number of elements can vary, such as implementing queues, stacks, and other dynamic data structures. |

### Additional Details:

- **Array**:
  - Arrays are best used when you need fast access to elements by index and when the size of the collection is known ahead of time. They offer constant time complexity for access operations but can be inefficient for insertions and deletions unless using dynamic arrays or lists that handle resizing.

- **Linked List**:
  - Linked lists are suitable when the size of the collection is unpredictable or frequently changing. They allow for efficient insertions and deletions at known positions but can be slower for random access due to their sequential nature. They also require extra memory for pointers.



# 8. What are the main operations of a queue? Describe their time complexities. 

# Main Operations of a Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. Below are the main operations of a queue and their time complexities:

## 1. Enqueue
- **Description**: Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Inserting an element at the rear is a constant-time operation, assuming there is available space in the underlying storage (e.g., an array or linked list).

## 2. Dequeue
- **Description**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Removing an element from the front is a constant-time operation as it involves accessing the front element and adjusting the pointer or index to the next element.

## 3. Front/Peek
- **Description**: Retrieves (but does not remove) the element at the front of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Accessing the front element is a constant-time operation, as it involves simply viewing the element at the front of the queue without modifying it.

## 4. IsEmpty
- **Description**: Checks whether the queue is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the queue is empty is a constant-time operation because it typically involves comparing the front and rear pointers or indices.

## 5. IsFull 
- **Description**: Checks whether the queue is full. This operation is relevant for bounded queues implemented with arrays.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the queue is full is a constant-time operation, as it involves comparing the current size or positions of the front and rear pointers.

### Summary of Time Complexities

- **Enqueue**: O(1)
- **Dequeue**: O(1)
- **Front/Peek**: O(1)
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)
- **IsFull**: O(1) (for bounded queues)

These operations ensure that queues efficiently manage elements in the order they are received.


# 9.Main Operations of a Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Below are the main operations of a stack and their time complexities:

## 1. Push
- **Description**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Adding an element to the top of the stack is a constant-time operation because it involves placing the element at the current top and updating the top pointer.

## 2. Pop
- **Description**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Removing the top element is a constant-time operation as it involves accessing and removing the top element and then updating the top pointer.

## 3. Top/Peek
- **Description**: Retrieves (but does not remove) the element at the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Accessing the top element is a constant-time operation because it involves viewing the top element without modifying the stack.

## 4. IsEmpty
- **Description**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the stack is empty is a constant-time operation, typically involving a simple comparison of the top pointer with a null or a specific value indicating an empty stack.

## 5. Size (optional)
- **Description**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) if maintained; O(n) if not maintained
  - **Explanation**: If the size is maintained as an additional variable, retrieving the size is a constant-time operation. Otherwise, it requires traversing the stack to count elements, which would take linear time.

### Summary of Time Complexities

- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Top/Peek**: O(1)
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)
- **Size (optional)**: O(1) if maintained; O(n) if not maintained

These operations ensure that stacks efficiently manage elements in a last-in, first-out order, useful for applications such as function call management, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms.

# 10. Describe the algorithm for evaluating postfix expressions using a stack 


# Algorithm for Evaluating Postfix Expressions

Evaluating postfix expressions (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) involves using a stack data structure to process the expression systematically. In postfix notation, operators follow their operands, eliminating the need for parentheses. 

## Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:
   - Create an empty stack to store operands.

2. **Read the Postfix Expression**:
   - Process each token (either an operand or an operator) from left to right.

3. **Process Each Token**:
   - **If the token is an operand (number)**:
     - Push the operand onto the stack.
   - **If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)**:
     - Pop the required number of operands from the stack (for binary operators, pop two operands).
     - Apply the operator to these operands:
       - `operand1 operator operand2`
     - Push the result back onto the stack.

4. **After Processing All Tokens**:
   - The stack should contain a single element, which is the result of the postfix expression.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - The remaining element in the stack is the final result of the expression.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Initialize**:
   - Create an empty stack.

2. **Read Tokens**:
   - For each token in the postfix expression:
     - **Operand**:
       - Push the operand onto the stack.
     - **Operator**:
       - Pop the top two operands from the stack (let's call them `operand2` and `operand1`).
       - Perform the operation: `operand1 operator operand2`.
       - Push the result of the operation back onto the stack.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all tokens, the stack should have exactly one element, which is the result of the postfix expression.
   - If the stack has more than one element or is empty at the end, there was an error in the expression.

## Example

Consider the postfix expression: `5 3 4 * + 2 -`

1. **Initialize an empty stack**.

2. **Process Tokens**:
   - Token `5`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5]`
   - Token `3`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5, 3]`
   - Token `4`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5, 3, 4]`
   - Token `*`: Pop `4` and `3`, compute `3 * 4 = 12`, push `12`. Stack: `[5, 12]`
   - Token `+`: Pop `12` and `5`, compute `5 + 12 = 17`, push `17`. Stack: `[17]`
   - Token `2`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[17, 2]`
   - Token `-`: Pop `2` and `17`, compute `17 - 2 = 15`, push `15`. Stack: `[15]`

3. **Final Result**:
   - The stack contains `[15]`, which is the result of the postfix expression.


# Psedocode

For each character in postfix expression do
    If character is a digit:
        Convert character to integer
        Push integer onto stack
    Else if character is an operator (+, -, *, /, %):
        Pop two operands from stack (operand2 and operand1)
        Perform the operation (operand1 operator operand2)
        Push the result onto stack
    Else:
        Print "Invalid character encountered!"

# 11. Explain the concept of a singly linked list and provide an example. 

- A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the 
 sequence. The last node in the list points to null, indicating the end of the list. This linear data structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations, making it a popular choice for various 
 applications.


### Representation of Singly Linked List

![337129135-b59452f5-41d1-4e90-8c27-722d090c329a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38186cbd-46b4-4674-bb89-85f963a5ba82)

Let's see how each node of the linked list is represented. Each node consists:


1.A data item

2.An address of another node

We wrap both the data item and the next node reference in a struct as:

### Syntax
```c
struct node
{
int data;
struct node *next;
};
```

## Visual Representation of a Singly Linked List

Let's consider a simple singly linked list with three nodes containing integers:

### Node Structure

1. **Node 1**: 
   - **Data**: `5`
   - **Next**: Pointer to Node 2

2. **Node 2**: 
   - **Data**: `10`
   - **Next**: Pointer to Node 3

3. **Node 3**: 
   - **Data**: `15`
   - **Next**: `NULL` (indicating the end of the list)

### Visual Diagram

```plaintext
Node 1              Node 2              Node 3
+--------+------+   +--------+------+   +--------+------+
|  Data  | Next ---->|  Data  | Next ---->|  Data  | Next ----> NULL
+--------+------+   +--------+------+   +--------+------+
|   5    |  2000 |   |   10   |  3000 |   |   15   | NULL |
+--------+------+   +--------+------+   +--------+------+
```

# Implemetation Of Singly LinkedList

    /* Connect nodes */
    one->next = two;

# 12. How does a doubly linked list differ from a singly linked list? 



- A doubly linked list is an extension of a singly linked list that allows traversal in both directions, while a singly linked list only allows traversal in one direction. Here’s a detailed comparison between 
 the two

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b192757-fd1e-4d96-a96d-b8cf20e3df05)


### Representation of Doubly Linked List in Data Structure:
- In a data structure, a doubly linked list is represented using nodes that have three fields:

- Data
- A pointer to the next node (next)
- A pointer to the previous node (prev).

```c
// Define the Node structure
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    struct Node* next;  // Pointer to the next node
    struct Node* prev;  // Pointer to the previous node
};
```

# Operations on Doubly Linked List

## 1. Traversal

### Forward Traversal
1. **Initialize** pointer to head.
2. **While** pointer is not `NULL`:
   - Visit data.
   - Move to next node.

### Backward Traversal
1. **Initialize** pointer to tail.
2. **While** pointer is not `NULL`:
   - Visit data.
   - Move to previous node.

## 2. Searching
1. **Initialize** pointer to head.
2. **While** pointer is not `NULL`:
   - Check if data matches.
   - If match, return node or position.
   - Move to next node.

## 3. Finding Length
1. **Initialize** counter to 0.
2. **Initialize** pointer to head.
3. **While** pointer is not `NULL`:
   - Increment counter.
   - Move to next node.
4. **Return** counter.

## 4. Insertion

### At the Beginning
1. **Create** new node.
2. **Set** new node’s `next` to head.
3. **Update** head’s `prev` to new node.
4. **Update** head to new node.

### At the End
1. **Create** new node.
2. **Traverse** to last node.
3. **Set** last node’s `next` to new node.
4. **Set** new node’s `prev` to last node.

### At a Specific Position
1. **Create** new node.
2. **Traverse** to position before desired one.
3. **Update** pointers to insert new node.

## 5. Deletion

### At the Beginning
1. **Update** head to second node.
2. **Set** new head’s `prev` to `NULL`.

### At the End
1. **Traverse** to last node.
2. **Update** second last node’s `next` to `NULL`.

### At a Specific Position
1. **Traverse** to node before target.
2. **Update** pointers to remove target node.


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define the structure of a Node for doubly linked list
struct Node {
    int data; // The data part of the node
    struct Node *prev; // Pointer to the previous node in the list
    struct Node *next; // Pointer to the next node in the list
};

// Function to display the doubly linked list
void display(struct Node *head) {
    struct Node *last;

    // Forward traversal
    printf("Forward: ");
    while (head != NULL) { // Traverse the list until the end
        printf("%d ", head->data); // Print the data of the current node
        last = head; // Store the current node as last
        head = head->next; // Move to the next node
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Backward traversal
    printf("Backward: ");
    while (last != NULL) { // Traverse the list backwards using the 'last' pointer
        printf("%d ", last->data); // Print the data of the current node
        last = last->prev; // Move to the previous node
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // Initialize pointers to nodes
    struct Node *head = NULL;
    struct Node *node2 = NULL;
    struct Node *node3 = NULL;
    struct Node *node4 = NULL;

    // Allocate memory for each node
    head = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    node2 = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    node3 = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    node4 = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    // Assign data to each node
    head->data = 15;
    node2->data = 10;
    node3->data = 12;
    node4->data = 3;

    // Link the nodes together
    head->prev = NULL;
    head->next = node2;

    node2->prev = head;
    node2->next = node3;

    node3->prev = node2;
    node3->next = node4;

    node4->prev = node3;
    node4->next = NULL;

    // Display the doubly linked list
    printf("Doubly Linked List:\n");
    display(head);

```
# 13.What is a circular linked list? 

Here, we can keep traversing forever and ever until the program crashes as the tail node's next pointer points to the head node instead of a NULL.

# 14. What is linear search, and what is its time complexity?


Definition:
Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm that checks each element of a list or array one by one until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached. It is also known as sequential search.

How It Works:

Start at the beginning of the list.
Compare each element with the target value.
If a match is found, return the index of the element.
If the end of the list is reached without finding the target, return an indication that the target is not present (e.g., -1 or null).
Characteristics:

Unsorted Data: Linear search does not require the list to be sorted.
Simple Implementation: Easy to implement and understand.
Time Complexity:

Best Case: 𝑂(1)
O(1) — The target value is found at the first position of the list.
Average Case: 𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) — The target value is found somewhere in the middle or may not be present at all.
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) — The target value is either not present in the list or is at the last position.
Where 𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06753f2c-699a-4302-b1b3-d45bb5e78dad)

Implementation
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Return the index of the target
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if the target is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 30;

    int result = linearSearch(arr, size, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element found at index %d\n", result);
    } else {
        printf("Element not found\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# 15. Explain binary search. How does it improve search efficiency compared to linear search? 

Definition:
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, narrowing down the potential locations of the target value.

How It Works:

Initialization: Start with two pointers, low and high, representing the bounds of the list (initially set to the first and last indices of the list, respectively).
Middle Element: Calculate the middle index, mid, of the current search interval.
Comparison:
If the middle element is equal to the target value, return the middle index.
If the target value is less than the middle element, adjust the high pointer to mid - 1 (search the left half).
If the target value is greater than the middle element, adjust the low pointer to mid + 1 (search the right half).
Repeat: Continue the process until the low pointer is greater than the high pointer, indicating that the target is not present in the list.
Result: Return -1 or another indication that the target value is not found.
Time Complexity:

Best Case: 𝑂(1)
O(1) — The target value is found at the middle index on the first comparison.
Average Case: 𝑂(log𝑛)
O(logn) — The search space is halved with each comparison.
Worst Case: 𝑂(log𝑛)
O(logn) — The target value is not present, and the search space is divided until the pointers converge.
Where 𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.

Efficiency Improvement:

Binary search is much more efficient than linear search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity 
𝑂(log𝑛)
O(logn), compared to linear search's 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n). Here's why:

Reduction in Search Space: Binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step, making the search process significantly faster compared to checking each element sequentially as in linear search.
Sorted Data Requirement: Binary search requires the data to be sorted. If the data is already sorted, binary search is highly efficient. However, if the data needs to be sorted first, the overall efficiency gain depends on the sorting algorithm used.

### PsedoCode
```c
Function LinearSearch(array, target)
    For each element in array do
        If element == target then
            Return the index of the element
        End If
    End For
    Return -1  // Target not found
End Function


```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform linear search
int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Return the index of the target if found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if the target is not found
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {3, 5, 2, 8, 7}; // Example array
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 8; // Element to search for

    // Perform linear search
    int result = linearSearch(arr, size, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d\n", target, result);
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found in the array\n", target);
    }

    return 0;

# 16. How does selection sort work? 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26bb193e-14a7-40e8-a71d-26211c8a7dff)

#  What is Selection Sort?
- Selection sort, also known as in-place comparison sort, is a simple sorting algorithm. It works on the idea of repeatedly finding the smallest element and 
 placing 
- it at its correct sorted position.
- Selection sort works by dividing the list into two sublists:
1.Sorted sublist — that is built on the left end of the list from left to right.
2.Unsorted sublist — that is the rest of the unsorted list, on the right end.

# Flowchart of the Selection Sort
- A flowchart for the Selection Sort algorithm could be described as follows:
1.Start: Begin the process.
2.Input List: Obtain the list or array to be sorted.
3.Initialize: Set the current index as the starting index. This represents the beginning of the unsorted portion of the list.
4.Find Minimum: Traverse the rest of the unsorted portion to find the smallest element.
5.Swap: Swap the smallest element found with the element at the current index.
6.Increment Index: Increase the current index by one, moving the boundary of the sorted and unsorted portions of the list.
7.Check: Check if the current index is less than the length of the list — 1. If it is, go back to the “Find Minimum” step. If it’s not, all elements have been 
 sorted.
8.End: End the process. The list is now sorted in ascending order.

# 19.Discuss Time complexity 

- The time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task with respect to input size (considering that each operation takes 
 the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one.

# Best case, Average case, and Worst case
- An algorithm can have different time for different inputs. It may take 1 second for some input and 10 seconds for some other input.
 For example: We have one array named “ arr” and an integer “ k “. we need to find if that integer “ k “ is present in the array “ arr “ or not? If the integer 
 is there, then return 1 other return 0. Try to make an algorithm for this question.

# Notation (theta)
- The Θ Notation is used to find the average bound of an algorithm i.e. it defines an upper bound and a lower bound, and your algorithm will lie in between these 
 levels. So, if a function is g(n), then the theta representation is shown as Θ(g(n)) and the relation is shown as:
```c
Θ(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0
          such that 0 ≤ c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```
- The above expression can be read as theta of g(n) is defined as set of all the functions f(n) for which there exists some positive constants c1, c2, and n0 
 such that c1g(n) is less than or equal to f(n) and f(n) is less than or equal to c2g(n) for all n that is greater than or equal to n0.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6763bf05-5c5b-42a1-9637-895282992960)

- In the above expression, a function f(n) belongs to the set Θ(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that it can be sandwiched between c1g(n) 
 and c2g(n), for sufficiently large n. If a function f(n) lies anywhere in between c1g(n) and c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0, then f(n) is said to be asymptotically tight 
 bound.

# Ω Notation
- The Ω notation denotes the lower bound of an algorithm i.e. the time taken by the algorithm can’t be lower than this. In other words, this is the fastest time 
 in which the algorithm will return a result. Its the time taken by the algorithm when provided with its best-case input. So, if a function is g(n), then the 
 omega representation is shown as Ω(g(n)) and the relation is shown as:
```c
Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 
          such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5546a5e2-3f7c-4da8-acc9-75e4ce347d6e)

- In the above expression, a function f(n) belongs to the set Ω(g(n)) if there exists a positive constant c such that it lies above cg(n), for sufficiently large 
 n. For any value of n, the minimum time required by the algorithm is given by Omega Ω(g(n)).

# Big O Notation
 The Big O notation defines the upper bound of any algorithm i.e. you algorithm can’t take more time than this time. In other words, we can say that the big O 
 notation denotes the maximum time taken by an algorithm or the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. So, big O notation is the most used notation for the 
 time complexity of an algorithm. So, if a function is g(n), then the big O representation of g(n) is shown as O(g(n)) and the relation is shown as:
```c
 O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0
          such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```

 1. What is Big-O?

• Big-O allows us to give an idea of the scalability of code.
• It tells how long it takes to run an algorithm. 
• As the number of elements increases how the number of operation increases determines algorithmic efficiency.
• Big-O concerns with the number of operations taken to complete a task.

2. Time Complexities of some common siniipets:
-Big Os - https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/

• O(1) Constant- no loops - Constant time – No matter how much the number of input increases the number of operations remains the same.

• O(log N) Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search) 

• O(n) Linear- for loops, while loops through n items 

• O(n log(n)) Log Linear- usually sorting operations 

• O(n^2) Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two nested loops 

• O(2^n) Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N 

• O(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element 

• Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
 
• Two separate collections: O(a * b)

• If loops are nested we multiply the Big-O = O (n * n) = O(n^2) = Quadratic times.

• If 1 loop for each different array, then Big-O = O (a + b).

• If 2 different inputs are nested, then Big-O = O (a * b).

• If 3 different inputs are nested, then Big-O = O (a * b * c).

• If 3 same inputs are nested, then Big-O = O (n * n * n).

3. What can cause time in a function?

• Operations (+, -, *, /)
• Comparisons (, ==)
• Looping (for, while)
• Outside Function call (function())

4. Rules for calculating Time Complexity.
  a. Always consider for wrost case.
  b. Remove constants.
  c. Take care for differnt terms of inputs.
  d. Drop Non Dominants.

### 20. Describe sparse matrix. Find the address of A [2][1] if base address is 1024 for an integer array A[5][4] in row major order and word size is 2 byte.
# Sparse Matrix
# Definition:
- A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In contrast to a dense matrix where most elements are non-zero, sparse matrices are 
 characterized by having a significant number of zero elements.

### Address Calculation in Row-Major Order

To find the address of an element in a two-dimensional array stored in row-major order, use the following formula:

**Address Formula:**

\[ \text{Address} = \text{Base Address} + \left[ (i \times \text{Number of Columns} + j) \times \text{Word Size} \right] \]

Where:
- \( i \) = Row index
- \( j \) = Column index
- Number of Columns = Number of columns in the array
- Word Size = Size of each element in bytes

**Example Calculation:**

Given:
- Base Address = 1024
- Array Dimensions: `A[5][4]` (5 rows, 4 columns)
- Word Size = 2 bytes
- Element to Find: `A[2][1]`

**Steps:**

1. **Row index (\( i \))**: 2
2. **Column index (\( j \))**: 1
3. **Number of Columns**: 4
4. **Word Size**: 2 bytes

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Address} = 1024 + \left[ (2 \times 4 + 1) \times 2 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 1024 + \left[ (8 + 1) \times 2 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 1024 + \left[ 9 \times 2 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 1024 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Address} = 1042 \]

**Result:**
The address of `A[2][1]` is **1042**.

### 21.Given a two dimensional array A1(1:8, 7:14) stored in row-major order with base address 
 100 and size of each element is 4 bytes, find address of the element A1(4, 12). 

### Address Calculation in Row-Major Order

To find the address of an element in a two-dimensional array stored in row-major order, use the following formula:

**Address Formula:**

\[ \text{Address} = \text{Base Address} + \left[ ((i - \text{Starting Row}) \times \text{Number of Columns} + (j - \text{Starting Column})) \times \text{Element Size} \right] \]

Where:
- \( i \) = Row index
- \( j \) = Column index
- Starting Row = 1
- Starting Column = 7
- Number of Columns = 8
- Element Size = 4 bytes

**Example Calculation:**

Given:
- Array: `A1(1:8, 7:14)`
- Base Address = 100
- Size of Each Element = 4 bytes
- Element to Find: `A1(4, 12)`

**Steps:**

1. **Row Index (\( i \))**: 4
2. **Column Index (\( j \))**: 12
3. **Starting Row**: 1
4. **Starting Column**: 7
5. **Number of Columns**: 8
6. **Element Size**: 4 bytes

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Address} = 100 + \left[ ((4 - 1) \times 8 + (12 - 7)) \times 4 \right] \]

Simplify:

\[ \text{Address} = 100 + \left[ (3 \times 8 + 5) \times 4 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 100 + \left[ (24 + 5) \times 4 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 100 + \left[ 29 \times 4 \right] \]
\[ \text{Address} = 100 + 116 \]
\[ \text{Address} = 216 \]

**Result:**
The address of `A1(4, 12)` is **216**.

### 22. Define dynamic memory allocation? 

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

**Definition:**

Dynamic memory allocation refers to the process of allocating and deallocating memory at runtime, as needed by a program. Unlike static memory allocation, which reserves a fixed amount of memory at compile time, dynamic memory allocation allows a program to request memory during execution, making it possible to handle varying data sizes and structures efficiently.

**Key Points:**

1. **Runtime Allocation:**
   - Memory is allocated during program execution rather than at compile time. This flexibility is useful for handling dynamic data structures that may change in size.

2. **Common Functions (in C/C++):**
   - **`malloc(size_t size)`**: Allocates a block of `size` bytes of memory and returns a pointer to it. The allocated memory is not initialized.
   - **`calloc(size_t num, size_t size)`**: Allocates memory for an array of `num` elements, each of `size` bytes, and initializes all bytes to zero.
   - **`realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)`**: Resizes the memory block pointed to by `ptr` to `size` bytes. It may move the block to a new location if necessary.
   - **`free(void *ptr)`**: Deallocates the memory previously allocated by `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`, making it available for future allocations.

3. **Advantages:**
   - **Flexibility**: Allows for the allocation of memory as needed, which is ideal for dynamic data structures like linked lists and dynamic arrays.
   - **Efficient Use**: Memory is allocated only when needed, potentially reducing wasted space.

4. **Disadvantages:**
   - **Overhead**: Allocating and deallocating memory incurs overhead.
   - **Memory Leaks**: If memory is not properly deallocated, it can lead to memory leaks.
   - **Fragmentation**: Repeated allocation and deallocation can lead to fragmentation, which may impact performance.

**Example in C:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Allocate memory for an integer
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    *ptr = 10; // Assign a value
    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr);

    // Reallocate memory for an array of 5 integers
    ptr = (int *)realloc(ptr, 5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory reallocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        ptr[i] = i + 1; // Assign values
    }

    // Print the values
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Value[%d]: %d\n", i, ptr[i]);
    }

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Self-Referential Structure in C

A **self-referential structure** in C is a structure that includes a pointer to an instance of the same structure type. This is essential for creating complex data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs. The self-reference allows for the dynamic linking of elements within these structures.

**Key Concept:**

- **Pointer to Same Type:** The structure contains a member that is a pointer to its own type, facilitating the creation of linked elements.

**Example of Self-Referential Structure:**

A common example is a node in a singly linked list. Below is a C structure definition for such a node:

```c
typedef struct Node {
    int data;              // Data part of the node
    struct Node *next;    // Pointer to the next node (same type of structure)
} Node;
```

# 29. Differentiate between LIFO and FIFO access mechanism. 

### LIFO vs FIFO Access Mechanism

**LIFO (Last In, First Out)** and **FIFO (First In, First Out)** are two different mechanisms used for accessing data in data structures. Here's how they differ:

| Feature                | LIFO (Last In, First Out)                  | FIFO (First In, First Out)              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | The last element added is the first to be removed. | The first element added is the first to be removed. |
| **Data Structure**     | Stack                                      | Queue                                    |
| **Access Pattern**     | Last added item is accessed first.         | First added item is accessed first.     |
| **Operations**         | - `Push` (add item) <br> - `Pop` (remove item) | - `Enqueue` (add item) <br> - `Dequeue` (remove item) |
| **Example Use Case**   | Function call stack, undo mechanisms       | Scheduling tasks, buffering data        |
| **Visual Representation** | ![LIFO]![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05eabec3-7fc2-41a4-a39f-d4dbbd565134) |
 | ![FIFO]![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85770284-392d-4e2c-be49-ea78b4bcdea8)|
| **Order of Removal**   | Reverse of order of insertion.             | Same as order of insertion.             |

#### Example:

- **LIFO Stack Operations:**
  - Push: [1] → [1, 2] → [1, 2, 3]
  - Pop: Removes 3, resulting in [1, 2]

- **FIFO Queue Operations:**
  - Enqueue: [1] → [1, 2] → [1, 2, 3]
  - Dequeue: Removes 1, resulting in [2, 3]

#### Summary:

- **LIFO**: Data is accessed in the reverse order of addition. Suitable for scenarios where the most recently added data should be processed first.
- **FIFO**: Data is accessed in the same order as addition. Suitable for scenarios where the earliest added data should be processed first.

### Comparison of Linked List with Stack, Queue, and Array

#### Linked List vs. Array

| Feature                     | Linked List                         | Array                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|

#### Dynamic Memory Allocation

- **Linked List**: 
  - Uses dynamic memory allocation, where each node is allocated memory as needed. This allows for efficient use of memory and flexibility in size. Nodes are 
 allocated and deallocated dynamically, making linked lists suitable for applications where the size of the data structure can change frequently.

- **Array**:
  - Uses static memory allocation, meaning the size of the array must be specified at compile time. This can lead to memory wastage if the array is not fully 
 utilized or overflow if the size is insufficient.

- **Stack and Queue**:
  - Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. When implemented with arrays, they suffer from the same limitations as arrays (fixed size). When implemented 
  with linked lists, they benefit from dynamic memory allocation, similar to linked lists.

#### Summary

- **Linked List**: 
  - Offers flexibility and efficient memory utilization due to dynamic memory allocation.
  - Suitable for scenarios where the size of the data structure frequently changes.

- **Array**: 
  - Provides constant-time access but lacks flexibility in size and can lead to memory wastage or overflow issues.

- **Stack and Queue**:
  - Efficiency and flexibility depend on the underlying implementation. Using linked lists for stacks and queues provides dynamic sizing and efficient memory 
 usage.

# 31. In which type of scenario, linear queue ( simple queue ) is better than circular queue? 
### Linear Queue vs. Circular Queue

#### When Linear Queue (Simple Queue) is Better

- A linear queue, also known as a simple queue, is a basic data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, following the FIFO 
 (First In, First Out) principle. While circular queues offer advantages in certain scenarios, there are specific situations where a linear queue might be more 
 appropriate:

1. **Simple Use Cases with Predictable Size**
   - **Scenario**: When the maximum size of the queue is known and fixed.
   - **Reason**: Linear queues are straightforward and simple to implement when the size of the queue is fixed and does not change frequently. They do not 
 require additional complexity for managing wrap-around situations as in circular queues.

2. **Non-Overlapping Operations**
   - **Scenario**: When queue operations do not overlap or interfere.
   - **Reason**: In scenarios where the operations on the queue are simple and do not require complex wrap-around logic, a linear queue is sufficient. For 
 example, processing tasks in a sequential manner without requiring re-usage of freed space.

3. **Ease of Implementation**
   - **Scenario**: When simplicity in code and implementation is a priority.
   - **Reason**: Linear queues are easier to understand and implement compared to circular queues. They do not involve the extra logic needed to handle the 
 circular nature of the queue, making them preferable for straightforward applications.

4. **Non-Critical Performance**
   - **Scenario**: When performance is not a critical concern, and the queue size is reasonably small.
   - **Reason**: For smaller queues where performance concerns related to space utilization and wrapping are minimal, a linear queue may be used. This is because 
 the additional overhead of circular queue management is not justified.

5. **Educational and Basic Examples**
   - **Scenario**: When used for educational purposes or simple examples.
   - **Reason**: Linear queues are often used in educational contexts to illustrate basic queue operations and principles without the added complexity of 
 circular queues.

#### Summary

- **Linear Queue**:
  - **Advantages**:
    - Simpler to implement and understand.
    - Suitable for fixed-size scenarios.
    - Easier to manage in non-critical performance applications.

- **Circular Queue**:
  - **Advantages**:
    - More efficient in space utilization for dynamic and continuous operations.
    - Avoids the problem of unused space at the start of the queue.

a linear queue is preferable in scenarios where simplicity, fixed size, and non-overlapping operations are key, whereas circular queues are better suited for 
 situations requiring efficient space utilization and continuous processing.

# 34. Apply selection sort algorithm on following input. 12, 29, 25, 8, 32, 17 , 40. Explain step by step. 

### Selection Sort Algorithm

- Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted 
 portion of the array and moves it to the beginning.

#### Input Array
12, 29, 25, 8, 32, 17, 40


#### Steps to Sort

1. **Initial Array**:

[12, 29, 25, 8, 32, 17, 40]


2. **Pass 1**:
- Find the minimum element in the array `[12, 29, 25, 8, 32, 17, 40]`, which is `8`.
- Swap `8` with the first element `12`.
- **Array After Pass 1**:
  ```
  [8, 29, 25, 12, 32, 17, 40]
  ```

3. **Pass 2**:
- Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array `[29, 25, 12, 32, 17, 40]`, which is `12`.
- Swap `12` with the second element `29`.
- **Array After Pass 2**:
  ```
  [8, 12, 25, 29, 32, 17, 40]
  ```

4. **Pass 3**:
- Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array `[25, 29, 32, 17, 40]`, which is `17`.
- Swap `17` with the third element `25`.
- **Array After Pass 3**:
  ```
  [8, 12, 17, 29, 32, 25, 40]
  ```

5. **Pass 4**:
- Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array `[29, 32, 25, 40]`, which is `25`.
- Swap `25` with the fourth element `29`.
- **Array After Pass 4**:
  ```
  [8, 12, 17, 25, 32, 29, 40]
  ```

6. **Pass 5**:
- Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array `[32, 29, 40]`, which is `29`.
- Swap `29` with the fifth element `32`.
- **Array After Pass 5**:
  ```
  [8, 12, 17, 25, 29, 32, 40]
  ```

7. **Pass 6**:
- The remaining unsorted array is `[32, 40]`. The smallest element is `32`.
- No swap needed as `32` is already in place.
- **Array After Pass 6**:
  ```
  [8, 12, 17, 25, 29, 32, 40]
  ```

8. **Pass 7**:
- The final element `40` is already in place, so no further action is needed.

# 35. Write an algorithm for bubble sort. Apply it on random 8 input data. 
### Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

#### Algorithm for Bubble Sort

1. **Start** from the beginning of the array.
2. **Compare** each pair of adjacent elements.
3. **Swap** the elements if they are in the wrong order.
4. **Repeat** the process for each pair in the array until the end of the array.
5. **Repeat** the entire process for all elements in the array, reducing the number of comparisons each time, as the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
6. **Terminate** when no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

#### Bubble Sort Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```c
BubbleSort(array A)
    n = length(A)
    for i = 0 to n-1 do
        for j = 0 to n-i-2 do
            if A[j] > A[j+1] then

### 36.Write Merge Sort algorithm. Apply the algorithm to the following elements: 10,5,28, 7, 39, 310, 55,15,1

# Merge Sort Algorithm

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts those subarrays, and then merges them to produce the sorted array. It is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n log n).

## Merge Sort Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```c
MergeSort(array A, left, right)
    if left < right then
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        MergeSort(A, left, mid)    // Recursively sort the left half
        MergeSort(A, mid + 1, right) // Recursively sort the right half
        Merge(A, left, mid, right) // Merge the sorted halves

```
```c
Merge(array A, left, mid, right)
    n1 = mid - left + 1
    n2 = right - mid

    // Create temporary arrays
    LeftArray = new array of size n1
    RightArray = new array of size n2

    // Copy data to temporary arrays
    for i = 0 to n1 - 1 do
        LeftArray[i] = A[left + i]
    for j = 0 to n2 - 1 do
        RightArray[j] = A[mid + 1 + j]

    // Merge the temporary arrays back into A
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = left

    while i < n1 and j < n2 do
        if LeftArray[i] <= RightArray[j] then
            A[k] = LeftArray[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            A[k] = RightArray[j]
            j = j + 1
        k = k + 1

    // Copy remaining elements of LeftArray[], if any
    while i < n1 do
        A[k] = LeftArray[i]
        i = i + 1
        k = k + 1

    // Copy remaining elements of RightArray[], if any
    while j < n2 do
        A[k] = RightArray[j]
        j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
```
