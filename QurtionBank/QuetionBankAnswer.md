# What is a data structure? Explain its importance

- A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. It provides a way to structure data so that it can be accessed and modified effectively. Common data structures 
 include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Importance of Data Structures:

- Efficiency: Different data structures offer various ways to store and retrieve data efficiently. For example, hash tables provide fast access to data, while trees can help with hierarchical data and efficient 
 searching.

- Performance: The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance of algorithms. For instance, a binary search tree allows for quicker searches, insertions, and deletions compared to a linear 
 search in an array.

- Resource Management: Data structures help in managing memory and other resources more effectively. They can optimize space and time complexity, which is crucial for handling large datasets.

- Algorithm Implementation: Many algorithms are built upon specific data structures. For example, graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm use priority queues (a type of data structure) to find the shortest path 
 between nodes.

- Abstraction and Modularity: Data structures provide a way to encapsulate and manage data separately from the operations performed on it. This abstraction helps in designing and implementing complex systems in a 
 modular fashion.

|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Order**                  | Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) order         | Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) order           |
| **Insertion Operation**    | Inserting an element is known as a `Push` operation. | Inserting an element is known as an `Enqueue` operation. |
| **Deletion Operation**     | Deleting an element is known as a `Pop` operation. | Deleting an element is known as a `Dequeue` operation. |
| **Pointer Usage**          | Utilizes a single pointer to the top of the stack. | Utilizes two pointers: one for the front and one for the rear of the queue. |
| **Type**                   | No specific types of stacks are available.     | Three main types of queues: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, and Priority Queue. |
| **Visualization**          | Vertical collection visualization (elements are stacked on top of each other). | Horizontal collection visualization (elements are lined up in a row). |
| **Accessibility**          | Only the ‘Top’ element is accessible.           | Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. |
| **Typical Use Cases**      | Function call management, expression evaluation, undo mechanisms. | Task scheduling, handling requests in a system, buffering data. |
| **Complexity**             | `Push` and `Pop` operations are typically O(1). | `Enqueue` and `Dequeue` operations are typically O(1). |

# 7.Comparison Between Array and Linked List

| **Aspect**                | **Array**                                          | **Linked List**                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**     | **Contiguous Memory**: Allocates a block of memory in a contiguous manner. | **Non-Contiguous Memory**: Uses scattered memory locations, with each element pointing to the next. |
| **Size**                  | **Fixed Size**: Size is determined at creation and cannot be changed dynamically. | **Dynamic Size**: Size can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. |
| **Access Time**           | **O(1) Access Time**: Direct access to elements using indices is possible, making retrieval very fast. | **O(n) Access Time**: Requires traversing the list from the head to access an element, making it slower. |
| **Insertion/Deletion**    | **O(n) Time Complexity**: Involves shifting elements, which can be costly for large arrays. | **O(1) Time Complexity (at known positions)**: Efficient insertion and deletion if the position is known, especially at the head or tail. |
| **Memory Overhead**       | **Low Overhead**: Minimal overhead as arrays do not store additional information apart from the elements. | **High Overhead**: Additional memory overhead due to storing pointers alongside data elements. |
| **Ease of Implementation**| **Simple Implementation**: Requires less code to implement basic operations. | **Complex Implementation**: Requires extra code to manage pointers and handle dynamic memory allocation. |
| **Traversal**             | **Linear Traversal**: Supports direct access to any element but requires linear traversal for operations like sorting. | **Sequential Traversal**: Requires traversing from the head, but traversal can be more flexible with doubly or circular linked lists. |
| **Resizing**              | **Static Size**: Does not support dynamic resizing; dynamic arrays (e.g., `ArrayList` in Java) handle resizing internally. | **Dynamic Size**: Supports resizing naturally as elements can be added or removed without resizing the entire structure. |
| **Use Cases**             | **Fixed-size Collections**: Suitable when the number of elements is known and does not change frequently, such as look-up tables. | **Dynamic Collections**: Ideal when the number of elements can vary, such as implementing queues, stacks, and other dynamic data structures. |

### Additional Details:

- **Array**:
  - Arrays are best used when you need fast access to elements by index and when the size of the collection is known ahead of time. They offer constant time complexity for access operations but can be inefficient for insertions and deletions unless using dynamic arrays or lists that handle resizing.

- **Linked List**:
  - Linked lists are suitable when the size of the collection is unpredictable or frequently changing. They allow for efficient insertions and deletions at known positions but can be slower for random access due to their sequential nature. They also require extra memory for pointers.

8. What are the main operations of a queue? Describe their time complexities. 

# Main Operations of a Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. Below are the main operations of a queue and their time complexities:

## 1. Enqueue
- **Description**: Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Inserting an element at the rear is a constant-time operation, assuming there is available space in the underlying storage (e.g., an array or linked list).

## 2. Dequeue
- **Description**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Removing an element from the front is a constant-time operation as it involves accessing the front element and adjusting the pointer or index to the next element.

## 3. Front/Peek
- **Description**: Retrieves (but does not remove) the element at the front of the queue.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Accessing the front element is a constant-time operation, as it involves simply viewing the element at the front of the queue without modifying it.

## 4. IsEmpty
- **Description**: Checks whether the queue is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the queue is empty is a constant-time operation because it typically involves comparing the front and rear pointers or indices.

## 5. IsFull 
- **Description**: Checks whether the queue is full. This operation is relevant for bounded queues implemented with arrays.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the queue is full is a constant-time operation, as it involves comparing the current size or positions of the front and rear pointers.

### Summary of Time Complexities

- **Enqueue**: O(1)
- **Dequeue**: O(1)
- **Front/Peek**: O(1)
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)
- **IsFull**: O(1) (for bounded queues)

These operations ensure that queues efficiently manage elements in the order they are received.


# Main Operations of a Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Below are the main operations of a stack and their time complexities:

## 1. Push
- **Description**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Adding an element to the top of the stack is a constant-time operation because it involves placing the element at the current top and updating the top pointer.

## 2. Pop
- **Description**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Removing the top element is a constant-time operation as it involves accessing and removing the top element and then updating the top pointer.

## 3. Top/Peek
- **Description**: Retrieves (but does not remove) the element at the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Accessing the top element is a constant-time operation because it involves viewing the top element without modifying the stack.

## 4. IsEmpty
- **Description**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - **Explanation**: Checking if the stack is empty is a constant-time operation, typically involving a simple comparison of the top pointer with a null or a specific value indicating an empty stack.

## 5. Size (optional)
- **Description**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) if maintained; O(n) if not maintained
  - **Explanation**: If the size is maintained as an additional variable, retrieving the size is a constant-time operation. Otherwise, it requires traversing the stack to count elements, which would take linear time.

### Summary of Time Complexities

- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Top/Peek**: O(1)
- **IsEmpty**: O(1)
- **Size (optional)**: O(1) if maintained; O(n) if not maintained

These operations ensure that stacks efficiently manage elements in a last-in, first-out order, useful for applications such as function call management, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms.

# 10. Describe the algorithm for evaluating postfix expressions using a stack 


# Algorithm for Evaluating Postfix Expressions

Evaluating postfix expressions (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) involves using a stack data structure to process the expression systematically. In postfix notation, operators follow their operands, eliminating the need for parentheses. 

## Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:
   - Create an empty stack to store operands.

2. **Read the Postfix Expression**:
   - Process each token (either an operand or an operator) from left to right.

3. **Process Each Token**:
   - **If the token is an operand (number)**:
     - Push the operand onto the stack.
   - **If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)**:
     - Pop the required number of operands from the stack (for binary operators, pop two operands).
     - Apply the operator to these operands:
       - `operand1 operator operand2`
     - Push the result back onto the stack.

4. **After Processing All Tokens**:
   - The stack should contain a single element, which is the result of the postfix expression.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - The remaining element in the stack is the final result of the expression.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Initialize**:
   - Create an empty stack.

2. **Read Tokens**:
   - For each token in the postfix expression:
     - **Operand**:
       - Push the operand onto the stack.
     - **Operator**:
       - Pop the top two operands from the stack (let's call them `operand2` and `operand1`).
       - Perform the operation: `operand1 operator operand2`.
       - Push the result of the operation back onto the stack.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all tokens, the stack should have exactly one element, which is the result of the postfix expression.
   - If the stack has more than one element or is empty at the end, there was an error in the expression.

## Example

Consider the postfix expression: `5 3 4 * + 2 -`

1. **Initialize an empty stack**.

2. **Process Tokens**:
   - Token `5`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5]`
   - Token `3`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5, 3]`
   - Token `4`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[5, 3, 4]`
   - Token `*`: Pop `4` and `3`, compute `3 * 4 = 12`, push `12`. Stack: `[5, 12]`
   - Token `+`: Pop `12` and `5`, compute `5 + 12 = 17`, push `17`. Stack: `[17]`
   - Token `2`: Push onto stack. Stack: `[17, 2]`
   - Token `-`: Pop `2` and `17`, compute `17 - 2 = 15`, push `15`. Stack: `[15]`

3. **Final Result**:
   - The stack contains `[15]`, which is the result of the postfix expression.


# Psedocode

Read postfix expression from user

For each character in postfix expression do
    If character is a digit:
        Convert character to integer
        Push integer onto stack
    Else if character is an operator (+, -, *, /, %):
        Pop two operands from stack (operand2 and operand1)
        Perform the operation (operand1 operator operand2)
        Push the result onto stack
    Else:
        Print "Invalid character encountered!"
        Exit with error

Pop the final result from stack

Print the result of postfix evaluation
